-----------------------------------
 Yet another wallpaper application
-----------------------------------

yawa is a fork of hsetroot, because there hasn't been a release in over 10
years, because upstream is dead, and because I really disliked some parts
of hsetroot.

Dependencies
============

* imlib2
* libx11

Building
========

::
    <git clone>
    cmake -g 'Unix Makefiles' .
    make
    sudo make install
